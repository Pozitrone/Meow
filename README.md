# Meow

There is never enough cats!
(And I wanted a simple bot with exactly the things I personally want ^.^)

## How it works
1. Write `meow`
2. Bot deletes your message
3. Bot posts a random cat picture
4. Bot adds a ❤️ reaction
5. Repeat! (optional, but recommended)

## How to run
You need to add `bot.json` file with bot token...
```json
{
    "token": "Your bot token"
}
```
... then use `node index.js` to run the bot.

##Permissions
- Send Messages (obviously)
- Embed links (so the image shows up in discord)
- Manage messages (so the bot can delete all the "meow" messages)
- Add reactions (Let's show the Love ❤️)
- Use external emoji (currently unused, but wip)
